Many parents suffer in observing what their children read, as they fear that they will read stories that do not suit their ages, such as horror stories. And also the owners of websites dedicated to story books suffer in classifying the appropriate stories for children, so we decided to make a model capable of classifying the appropriate and the inappropriate stories for children.

We tried more than one model and it was the  semantic value in Non-negative matrix factorization for appropriate stories for children is :

And for inappropriate stories for children:

Here we have presented the most frequently used words in stories that appropriate for children

So we think Non-negative matrix factorization model  is a suitable model for us , but we will try clustring and we will choose the best model
